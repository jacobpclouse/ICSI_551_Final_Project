# ICSI_551_Final_Project
Final Projects are required for both Graduate Students and PHY 451Y students. Students can choose to work individually or in groups of two to propose, perform, and present a final project for the course. This project will be a project that uses methods taught in this course to solve a data analysis or signal processing problem.

## FAQ:
- Final Project Report is inside the Documentation folder
- All Code is inside the Code folder, the EV3 folder has the sample hardware tests I used and the hardware function references
- The Code/NestedSampling Folder is where I put the adjustments to the robot code that Dr. Knuth provided. Part 1 is where the EV3 adjusted code is (we will use this when we get the color sensor working again). Part 2 is a sample program to prove that the nested sampling still works with hard coded input. 
- The Lego Classroom for Mindstorm folder has a sample project to use as a control to see if the motors are working and connect to the pc properly.
